# Note [Deferrable constraints]
# -----------------------------
# Only some types of PostgreSQL constraint can be DEFERRED, and
# they may be deferred if they are created with the DEFERRABLE option.
#
# These types of constraints can be DEFERRABLE:
# - UNIQUE
# - PRIMARY KEY
# - REFERENCES (foreign key)
# - EXCLUDE
#
# These types of constraints can never be DEFERRABLE:
# - CHECK
# - NOT NULL
#
# By default, Django makes foreign key constraints DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
# so they are checked at the end of the transaction,
# rather than when the statement is executed.
#
# All other constraints are IMMEDIATE (and not DEFERRABLE) by default.
# This can be changed by passing the `deferrable` argument to the constraint.
#

    """
    Temporarily set named DEFERRABLE constraints to IMMEDIATE.

    This is useful for catching constraint violations as soon as they occur,
    rather than at the end of the transaction.

    This is especially useful for foreign key constraints in Django,
    which are DEFERRED by default.

    We presume that any provided constraints were previously DEFERRED,
    and we restore them to that state after the context manager exits.

    To be sure that the constraints are restored to DEFERRED
    even if an exception is raised, we use a savepoint.

    This could be expensive if used in a loop because on every iteration we would
    create and close (or roll back) a savepoint, and set and unset the constraint state.
